AWSCloudWatchSample
===================

A sample of using AWS's CloudWatch API with iOS.

## This sample describes The first step to use CloudWatch API

Just output log of your recent expense from CloudWatch. It's really easy to take it. But there are few samples. So I write this sample.

## How to

1. Check **Receive Billing Alerts** in My Account > Preferences.
2. Make **Access Key Id** and **Secret Access Key**.
3. Download [AWS SDK for iOS](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/)
4. Add **AWSRuntime.framework** and **AWSCloudWatch.framework** into your project.
6. See **ACSViewContrlller.m** how to write.
7. Done!
